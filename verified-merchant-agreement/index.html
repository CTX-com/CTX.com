<h2>Verified Merchant Agreement</h2>
<p>Last Updated 9th July 2021</p>

<p>This Verified Merchant Agreement (“Agreement”), which begins on __________ (“Effective Date”) is a contract between  __________________ hereinafter referred to as (“Client”, “you,” or “your”), and Astound Group Ltd. (“CTX,” “we,” “Company,”, or “us”).</p>

<p>Client and CTX being individually a “Party” and together the “Parties”, and applies to Client or Client’s End Users’ (as defined below) use of: (a) the CTX website located at www.CTX.com, the CTX API, and any associated CTX-hosted websites or mobile applications (collectively the “CTX Site”), and (b) any of the services provided to Client or to the users of Client’s products or services (collectively, “End Users,” “User(s)”)) by CTX (together with the CTX Site, the “Services”).</p>


<h3>1. RECITALS</h3>

<p>WHEREAS, Client desires to obtain access to the Company’s Services for itself and its End Users;</p>

<p>NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>


<h3>2. GENERAL OBLIGATIONS</h3>

<strong>2.1 Description of Services; Performance of Professional Services.</strong> 
<p>CTX will provide you with access to our Services throughout the term of this Agreement. You may use these Services to refer End Users through CTX's transactional flows which are all subject to the requirements and limits found in the API Documentation and this Agreement. Within reasonable means, CTX may also provide, at no cost to Client, such integration and implementation services as may be required to expose API endpoints so that Client can successfully integrate the Service into Client’s user flow in-app, in a manner that allows End Users to use the Service without leaving the Client interface (collectively, the “Professional Services'').</p>

<strong>2.2. Payment. </strong>
<p>CTX may collect a transaction fee from each End User as according to Exhibit A (each, a “Transaction Fee”). CTX and Client can agree to charge an additional fee in which the Client communicates to CTX and is described within Exhibit A (“Client Fee”).</p>

<strong>2.3. Account.</strong>
<p>To operate the Services mentioned within this Agreement, Client will need to create an account and identify an administrative username and password (“Client Account”). You may provide access to your platform account to multiple platform employees or agents. You are solely responsible for the designation of such users and their privileges (e.g., view only vs. administrative read and write privileges) and any actions or inactions made by these employees and/or agents on your behalf.</p>

<strong>2.4. API Keys.</strong>
<p>CTX will provide you with API keys for your account to interact with the production environment. Your API keys are Confidential Information (as defined in Section 3.12) of CTX. You are prohibited from selling, transferring, sub-licensing, or disclosing your API keys or other credentials to any third party, other than a service provider performing services on your behalf that has been disclosed to us in writing. You understand and agree that you are liable for any actions performed using your API keys, account credentials or other CTX credentials, except to the extent that such actions were enabled as the result of the negligent acts or omissions of CTX, its employees or agents.</p>

<strong>2.5. Term.</strong>
<p>This Agreement will commence on the date of last signature and will continue thereafter for 1 year. Thereafter, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms (each a “Renewal Term”), unless either Party provides written notice of their intent not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.</p>

<strong>2.6. No Exclusivity. </strong>
<p>This Agreement is not exclusive. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent Client from obtaining services that are similar to or competitive with the Services from any third party. </p>

<strong>2.7. Termination.</strong>
<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon 60 days’ written notice. Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party has breached this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the breach from the non-breaching party.</p>

<strong>2.8. Expenses. </strong>
<p>CTX agrees to reimburse any pre-approved out of pocket expenses incurred by Client in connection with the Services, including, but not limited to, travel expenses, audit fees, tax fees, payroll service fees, etc. </p>

<strong>2.9. Ownership. </strong>
<p>You agree and acknowledge that, as between the parties, we own all right, title and interest to and in the Services, the associated software, technology tools and content, the content displayed on the website, the CTX Marks (defined below) and other materials produced by and related to CTX (collectively, the “CTX IP”).

We hereby grant you a personal, limited, non-transferable license to use CTX’s name, logos, and trademarks solely for the purpose of identifying CTX as the provider of the Services and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You shall not rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, transfer, copy, reproduce, download, display, modify or timeshare the CTX IP; except that nothing in this Agreement will restrict Client from or subject Client to liability for allowing third party distributed applications to utilize the Services via the Client product interface. CTX IP shall be treated as CTX Confidential Information hereunder. You shall not prepare any derivative work based on the CTX IP, nor shall you translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the CTX IP. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. </p>

<strong>2.10. Advertising. </strong>
<p>Client acknowledges and agrees to grant CTX a personal, limited, non-transferable license to use Client’s name, logos, and trademarks solely for the purpose of identifying Client as a customer of the Services and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

<p><strong>2.15.2.</strong> was generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at the time of its disclosure hereunder to the receiving party; </p>
