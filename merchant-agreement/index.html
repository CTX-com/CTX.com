<h3>2. Payments Services</h3>

<p><strong><em>2.1</em></strong> The “Payments Services” provided by CTX exist solely out of allowing Users to access the payments web-app and mobile apps built by CTX, through which End-Users can make payment to Users wishing to receive payment in cryptocurrency (“Merchants”).</p>

<p><strong><em>2.2</em></strong> For the purpose of our Merchant Services for unverified merchants, CTX is solely a provider of technical infrastructure allowing for generation of payment QR codes and payment monitoring services. CTX never holds merchant or customer cryptocurrency or fiat. CTX is not party to any transactions which may occur between End-Users and Merchants.</p>

<p><strong><em>2.3</em></strong> CTX has a limited capacity to provide customer support for transactions between End-Users and Merchants. CTX is not able to provide customer support regarding transactions, cancellations, refunds, payment issues, customer issues or otherwise. Any contractual agreements, terms, and conditions applicable to transactions between End-Users and Merchants are governed by the relevant agreement(s) in place between End-Users and Merchants.</p>

<p><strong><em>2.4</em></strong> In order to provide and optimize our Payments Services, we process a limited amount of user data, as governed by CTX’s privacy policy.</p>


<h2>3. Risk Disclosures</h2>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> In order to be completed, any virtual currency transaction created with the CTX Payments Services must be confirmed and recorded in the virtual currency ledger associated with the relevant virtual currency network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by CTX.com.</p>

<p><strong>3.2.</strong> CTX.com has no control over any virtual currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit and/or receive via CTX will be confirmed on the relevant virtual currency network. The transaction details you submit and/or receive via CTX may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the virtual currency network or third party used to process the transaction. We do not guarantee that CTX can transfer title or right in any virtual currency or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title.</p>

<p><strong>3.3.</strong> Once transaction details have been submitted to a virtual currency network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. CTX.com has no control over any virtual currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.</p>

<h2>4. Network Upgrade</h2>
<p>A "Network Upgrade" or "Fork" means a change to the underlying protocol of a virtual currency network that may result in more than one version of a virtual currency, the result of which may be one or more versions that are not supported by CTX. In the event of a Fork or other network disruption, CTX.com may not be able to support activity related to your virtual currency. In the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. CTX.com is not responsible for any loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork or other network disruption.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping your CTX password, api keys and any other credentials secret. You are responsible for keeping any point of sale devices secure. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of virtual currency associated with your CTX account.</p>

<h2>6. Fees</h2>
<p>CTX.com does not currently charge a fee for using our unverified merchant Payments Services. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees. Network fees (including, without limitation "miner's fees") required to use a virtual currency network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient or it may be excessive. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee and CTX.com shall neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.</p>

<h2>7. Rates</h2>
<p>CTX.com provides cryptocurrency to fiat conversion rates for informational purposes only, we make no representations regarding the quality, suitability, truth, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data, and you should not rely on such data.</p>
