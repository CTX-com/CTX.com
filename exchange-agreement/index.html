<h3>2. Exchange Services</h3>

<p><strong><em>2.1</em></strong> The “Exchange Services” provided by CTX exist solely out of allowing End-Users to access the exchange widget and exchange API built by CTX, through which End-Users can interact and transact with various third parties that offer fiat-to-cryptocurrency conversion services (“Fiat Gateways”).</p>

<p><strong><em>2.2</em></strong> For the purpose of our Exchange Services, CTX is solely a provider of technical infrastructure allowing supply and demand for fiat-to-crypto conversion services, customer and wallets to find each other and does not sell cryptocurrencies, does not convert fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies and never holds customers fiat currencies. CTX is not party to any transactions which may occur between End-Users and third-party Fiat Gateways, and CTX does not take custody of End-User funds.</p>

<p><strong><em>2.3</em></strong> CTX has a limited capacity to provide customer support for transactions between End-Users and Fiat Gateways. CTX is not able to provide customer support regarding identification procedures and transaction monitoring (Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering procedures), cancellations, refunds and transaction limits. Any contractual agreements, terms, and conditions applicable to transactions between End-Users and third-party Fiat Gateways are governed by the relevant agreement(s) in place between End-Users and third-party Fiat Gateways.</p>

<p><strong><em>2.4</em></strong> In order to provide and optimize our Exchange Services, we process a limited amount of user data, as governed by CTX’s privacy policy. All other personal data, which is inputted by users and processed in relation to transactions between End-Users and third-party Fiat Gateways, is governed by the privacy policies of such Fiat Gateways, which policies are to be accepted by the End-User upon making such transactions, together with the terms and conditions from those Fiat Gateways.</p>

<h3>3. Warranties</h3>
<p><strong><em>3.1</em></strong> As CTX is not a party to transactions between End-Users and Fiat Gateways, we cannot and do not make any representations or warranties of any kind with regards such transactions or the services provided by Fiat Gateways.</p>

<p><strong><em>3.2</em></strong> CTX’s Exchange Services, Exchange widget(s) and/or Exchange API(s) are provided ‘as is’, and while we represent that we will make reasonable endeavors to ensure our Exchange Services meet your expectations, we make no representations or warranties about:</p>

<p>a) the uptime, reliability or availability of our Exchange Services, or about our Exchange Services being completely error-free, as they might go offline or be unreliable for a variety of reasons, including reasons related to updates, problems with communication networks, hardware problems, software problems, bugs, external attacks or other reasons;</p>

<p>b) the correctness of information displayed on our website, widget or through our API, including, but not limited to information about available Fiat Gateways, information about offers made by Fiat Gateways such as applicable conversion ratios, information about fees applicable to such offers, and information about network fees, as such conversion ratios and fees may be subject to changes for a variety of reasons (such as transaction delays, market volatility and sudden network congestion) outside of CTX’s control, before, during or even after transactions have been initiated;</p>

<p>c) the legitimacy, availability, suitability for purpose, security or reliability of fiat-to-crypto conversion services offered by third-party Fiat Gateways, as we have no control over such services; and</p>

<p>d) the legitimacy, availability, suitability for purpose, security or reliability of implementations of CTX's Exchange API or Exchange Widget where these are integrated and/or adapted by third-party wallets, applications, websites, exchanges or protocols.</p>

<h3>4. User warranties</h3>
<p><strong><em>4.1</em></strong> You, as End-User, shall not:</p>

<p>a) copy, modify, create derivative works of, adapt, emulate, translate, reverse engineer, compile, decompile or disassemble any portion of the widget, website or API in any way;</p>

<p>b) interfere with or violate any right to privacy or other rights, or harvest or collect personally identifiable information about visitors or End-Users without their express and informed consent, including using any robot, spider, site search or retrieval application, or other manual or automatic device or process to retrieve, index, or data-mine;</p>

<p>c) interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Exchange Services, or the servers or networks that host the Exchange Services or make the Exchange Services available, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of such servers or networks;</p>

<p>d) provide any false, misleading or inaccurate information or impersonate others;</p>

<p>e) enter into this agreement on behalf of any third party; or</p>

<p>f) violate any applicable laws by entering into this agreement.</p>

<h3>5. Limitation of liability</h3>
<p><strong><em>5.1</em></strong> In no event shall CTX be held liable for any damages of any kind related to possible contractual relation(s) and transaction(s) between End-Users and third-party Fiat Gateways, as CTX is not a party to such transactions.</p>

<p><strong><em>5.2</em></strong> CTX shall further not be held liable for any costs or damages resulting from any incorrectness of information displayed on our website, widget or through our API, for any errors, bugs, hacks, breaches, viruses, worms, harmful software or (other) attacks aimed at our security or the security of other infrastructure or third-party interfaces related or connected to the Exchange Services, for any incorrect data input by the End-User, any incorrect performance of our Exchange Services, and any malfunctioning of any computer, server or blockchain, including attacks on such components, unless these damages are attributable to gross negligence or intent on the side of CTX.</p>

<p><strong><em>5.3</em></strong> CTX shall further not be held liable for indirect damages, including, but not limited to, lost profits, lost income, missed opportunity, appreciation or depreciation of (digital) assets or consequential damages claimed to arise as a result of (a lack of) availability, reliability or a lack of uptime of CTX’s Exchange Services.</p>

<p><strong><em>5.4</em></strong> CTX shall further not be held liable for damages resulting from any incorrectness of data input by the user, including incorrect input of public keys, which may result in the End-User losing all its funds, as well as any damages resulting from any risks that are inherently related to the owning and/or use of cryptocurrencies or other digital tokens, such as damages resulting from unknown technical defects, legislative or regulatory changes, any fluctuations in value.</p>

<p><strong><em>5.5</em></strong> In any case, CTX’s liability to any specific End-User will be limited to the total amount of revenue CTX has received from a third-party Fiat Gateway for its Exchange Services in relation to that specific End-User.</p>
